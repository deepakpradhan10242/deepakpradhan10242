## Hi there, I'm Deepak Pradhan!

I'm an engineer-in-training, full-stack developer by choice, and problem solver by curiosity. I love simplifying complex ideas and building tools that make life easier, whether it’s through clean code, smart systems, or creative collaboration.

🌱 I’m currently exploring system design and scalability.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on full-stack web apps, open-source projects, or developer tools that push boundaries.
