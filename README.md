## Hi there, I'm Deepak Pradhan!

I'm an engineer-in-training, full-stack developer by choice, and problem solver by curiosity. I love simplifying complex ideas and building tools that make life easier, whether it’s through clean code, smart systems, or creative collaboration.

🌱 I’m currently exploring system design and scalability.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on full-stack web apps, open-source projects, or developer tools that push boundaries.


📫 How to reach me: deepak.pradhan4364@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/deepakpradhan10242/)

⚡ Fun fact: I once helped 50+ people build and deploy their first websites—and most of them didn’t know what a “div” was before that.
